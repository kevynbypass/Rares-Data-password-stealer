To use Rares Data + password stealer, simply plug in the USB drive containing the software. However, it's important to note that unless you have experience, you should not attempt to modify any files.

When you're finished using the bat file, it's important to remove the USB drive safely to prevent data corruption. Additionally, each time you use the the bat file, it will automatically remove the AUTORUN and Openfile files.
